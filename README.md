TASK 1:

Using basic programming concepts like if-else statements and predefined responses, this project is a simple chatbot that listens to user inputs, compares them with a set of predefined queries stored in a dictionary, and provides appropriate responses based on the input. The chatbot uses a loop to continuously interact with the user until the user types "bye," at which point the conversation ends. It is made to understand basic queries like "hi," "what is your name," and "how are you," providing dictionary-based responses. This project provides a basic understanding of how chatbots operate and can be expanded with more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for improved interaction.

TASK 2:

The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is used in this artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game to guarantee optimal gameplay. You, the human, and the AI are the two participants in the game. By analyzing every move that may be made and selecting the optimal one using a depth-first search method that minimizes the potential loss, the AI aims to win. Because the game is created using an object-oriented, class-based methodology, the code is easily extensible and flexible. The class handles the game board, movements, and winner checks, offering an organized and effective method of controlling the game flow. The AI guarantees a competitive battle whether you play as X or O!

TASK 3:

This project is an image captioning system that creates informative captions for photographs by fusing natural language processing with computer vision. It makes use of a Vision-Encoder-Decoder model (ViT-GPT2), which combines GPT-2 for text caption generation with a Vision Transformer (ViT) for picture feature extraction. Furthermore, a pre-trained ResNet50 model is employed for feature extraction, demonstrating an alternate approach to picture analysis.After processing an input image, the system uses the Vision Transformer to extract its features and GPT-2 to create a caption. For improved visualization, it also comes with a tool to show the image along with the generated caption. This research shows how state-of-the-art deep learning models can be integrated to produce intelligent, automated image captioning.

TASK 4:

This project is a straightforward recommendation system made to make suggestions to users about movies or books depending on their interests. It analyzes user-item interactions through collaborative filtering, using cosine similarity on normalized data to determine user commonalities. The algorithm uses ratings from comparable users, weighted by how similar they are, to estimate a score when a user hasn't reviewed an item. In order to effectively tailor recommendations, it lastly suggests the top products with the greatest expected ratings for a user.

TASK 5:

This project is a real-time face identification system that recognizes faces in a live webcam video feed using Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model called the Haar Cascade classifier to analyze grayscale photos and identify faces. After analyzing every video frame, the algorithm looks for faces and highlights them with green rectangles. It has an easy-to-use interface with a live stream; the detection continues until the user hits the 'a' key to stop it. This project shows how to successfully use computer vision techniques for face detection.
